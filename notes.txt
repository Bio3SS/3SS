* Your assignment for this week is the [Introduction to R worksheet](http://lalashan.mcmaster.ca/theobio/3SS/index.php/Introduction_to_R). It is due on Fri Feb 2. You do _not_ need to hand it in, but you _do_ need to do it. If you don't do it, you should not bother us about any troubles you have running R after that.

* Tutorials for the week of 30 January are _mandatory_; they will focus on the [Introduction to R worksheet](http://lalashan.mcmaster.ca/theobio/3SS/index.php/Introduction_to_R), class material, and the [for-credit assignment](/materials/pg.asn.pdf).
	* You should look at the worksheet and install the requested programs _before your tutorial_ if possible (sorry for late notice).
